OLX Europe Auto-Poster â€” README

A production-ready template for an application that automatically posts adverts from your database to OLX using the OLX Europe Partner Public API. It supports posting and updating listings, syncing status, and exchanging messages with OLX users via the internal messaging system.

Note: OLX provides a unified Partner API across European markets; only market-specific configuration (site/locale/category IDs, policies) needs to vary per country.
